The series is widely regarded as a masterpiece of animation, with a captivating story, rich characters, and stunning visuals. It also features an iconic soundtrack composed by Nobuyoshi Koshibe. The series has been remastered and released on DVD and Blu-ray, but it is not available on any streaming platform. So how can you watch it online?
  
One option is to download it from torrent sites. Torrenting is a method of peer-to-peer file sharing that allows users to download files from other users' computers. However, torrenting is illegal in many countries and can expose you to malware, viruses, and legal issues. Therefore, we do not recommend this option.
  
A safer and more reliable option is to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service. A VPN is a software that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another country. This way, you can access geo-restricted content from anywhere in the world. For example, you can use a VPN to connect to a French server and watch Les MystÃ©rieuses CitÃ©s d'or on the official website of TF1, the French broadcaster that owns the rights to the series.
  
To use a VPN, you need to sign up for a VPN service provider and download their app on your device. There are many VPN services available online, but some are better than others. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a VPN:
  
- Speed: You want a VPN that offers fast and consistent speeds, so you can watch Les MystÃ©rieuses CitÃ©s d'or without buffering or lagging.
- Security: You want a VPN that uses strong encryption and protocols, so your data and identity are protected from hackers and snoopers.
- Privacy: You want a VPN that does not keep logs of your online activity, so your browsing history and personal information are not exposed to third parties.
- Compatibility: You want a VPN that works on multiple devices and platforms, so you can watch Les MystÃ©rieuses CitÃ©s d'or on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV.
- Customer support: You want a VPN that offers 24/7 customer support, so you can get help if you encounter any issues or questions.
